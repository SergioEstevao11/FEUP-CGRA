## TP 2 Notes

 
-In exercise 2 we had to use the objects we created the class before in order to draw a tangram provided to us.
We had some dificulties in the interface but was quickly fixed.
-In exercise 3 we had to draw a cube and then using geometric trasformations we had to place the tangram on top of the cube.
-In exercise 4 we had to create a new unitary cube by drawing the faces of the cube and we had to substitute the previous cube by this new one.
